// Yatharth and Anamika are playing a game. Anamika loves Yatharth very much and she wants to share a chocolate bar with him in which each of the squares consists of an integer represented by 
// A
// [
// i
// ]
// . 

// She decides to share a contiguous segment of the chocolate bar selected such that the length of the segment matches Yatharth's birth month 
// M
//  and the sum of the integers on the squares is equal to his birthday 
// D
// . 

// You must determine how many ways she can divide the chocolate.
